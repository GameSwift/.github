## About GameSwift
__GameSwift__ is a one-stop __gaming ecosystem__ that aims to introduce cross-chain interoperability to __Web3 gaming__. 
Imagine the possibility of signing into your favorite game with one account, like your Google or AppleID, instead of using various wallets, chains, and networks. It's only a tiny part of what __GameSwift__ can do!

The __GameSwift ecosystem__ is based on four great pillars: __Chain, Platform, Web3 Infrastructure, and Gaming Studio__. All of them are well designed and integrated with each other to let the players enjoy their __gaming__ experience to the fullest, while giving game developers the ability to share in-game resources without forcing them to exist in __only one chain__.
